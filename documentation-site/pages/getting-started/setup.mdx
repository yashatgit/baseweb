# Setup

## Installing Base Web

Base Web is available on npm as [baseui](https://npmjs.com/package/baseui). This single
package contains all Base Web components.

```bash
# using yarn
yarn add baseui styletron-engine-atomic styletron-react

# using npm
npm install baseui styletron-engine-atomic styletron-react
```

Base Web comes with both Flow and TypeScript. Styletron comes only with Flow. However, if you use
TypeScript there are external TypeScript declarations:

```bash
yarn add @types/styletron-standard @types/styletron-react @types/styletron-engine-atomic
```

Our React components don't use [PropTypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html).

[Styletron](https://www.styletron.org/) is a toolkit for component-oriented styling, part of the
CSS in JS family. Base Web uses Styletron as a peer dependency to style all the elements, so you
need to add them as dependencies too.

### `eslint-plugin-baseui`

Base Web also has a plugin for [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) that will warn you if you are using a deprecated component or API. It also flags certain common mistakes developers make when using `baeui`. In some cases it can also auto-fix issues for you!

Assuming you already have ESLint installed, run:

```sh
# npm
npm install eslint-plugin-baseui --save-dev

# yarn
yarn add eslint-plugin-baseui --dev
```

Then add it to your ESLint configuration:

```js
{
  "plugins": [
    // ...
    "baseui",
  ],
  "rules": {
    // ...
    'baseui/deprecated-theme-api': "warn",
    'baseui/deprecated-component-api': "warn",
    'baseui/no-deep-imports': "warn",
  }
}
```

`baseui` and `eslint-plugin-baseui` have their versions synced, so you should generally bump them together and always keep them on the same version:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "baseui": "10.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "eslint-plugin-baseui": "10.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Adding Base Web to Your Application

In order to use Base Web, you need to do a small setup and wrap the root of your
application with `StyletronProvider` and [`BaseProvider`](https://baseweb.design/components/base-provider) components:

```javascript
import {Client as Styletron} from 'styletron-engine-atomic';
import {Provider as StyletronProvider} from 'styletron-react';
import {LightTheme, BaseProvider, styled} from 'spaceweb';
import {StatefulInput} from 'spaceweb/input';

const engine = new Styletron();

const Centered = styled('div', {
  display: 'flex',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  alignItems: 'center',
  height: '100%',
});

export default function Hello() {
  return (
    <StyletronProvider value={engine}>
      <BaseProvider theme={LightTheme}>
        <Centered>
          <StatefulInput />
        </Centered>
      </BaseProvider>
    </StyletronProvider>
  );
}
```

There are detailed guides for Styletron setup for the following frameworks:

- [Fusion.js](https://www.styletron.org/getting-started/#with-fusionjs)
- [Next.js](https://www.styletron.org/getting-started/#with-nextjs)
- [Gatsby](https://www.styletron.org/getting-started/#with-gatsby)
- [Other React applications](https://www.styletron.org/getting-started/#with-react)
